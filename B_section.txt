Interest Analysis
1-Which interests have been present in all month_year dates in our dataset?
2-Using this same total_months measure - calculate the cumulative percentage of all records starting at 14 months - which total_months value passes the 90% cumulative percentage value?
3-If we were to remove all interest_id values which are lower than the total_months value we found in the previous question - how many total data points would we be removing?
4-Does this decision make sense to remove these data points from a business perspective? Use an example where there are all 14 months present to a removed interest example for your arguments - think about what it means to have less months present from a segment perspective.
5-After removing these interests - how many unique interests are there for each month?

1. Which interests have been present in all month_year dates in our dataset?

SELECT interest_id
FROM interest_metrics
GROUP BY interest_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) = 
(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) FROM interest_metrics);

2. Calculate the cumulative percentage of all records starting at 14 months. 
Which total_months value passes the 90% cumulative percentage value?

WITH months AS (
    SELECT 
        interest_id, 
        COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) AS total_month
    FROM 
        interest_metrics
    GROUP BY 
        interest_id
),
cumulative AS (
    SELECT 
        total_months,
        COUNT(*) AS count,
        SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY total_month) AS cum_count
        SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER () AS total_count
    FROM 
        months
    GROUP BY 
        total_month
)
SELECT 
    total_month
    ROUND(100.0 * cum_count / count, 2) AS percent
FROM 
    cumulative
WHERE 
    percent >= 90
LIMIT 1;

3. If we remove all interest_id values lower than the total_months value from the previous question,
 how many total data points would we be removing?

WITH interest AS (
    SELECT 
        interest_id, 
        COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) AS total
    FROM 
       interest_metrics
    GROUP BY 
        interest_id
),
cumulative AS (
    SELECT 
        total,
        COUNT(*) AS count,
        SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY total) AS cum_count,
        SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER () AS total_count
    FROM 
        interest
    GROUP BY 
        total
),
threshold AS (
    SELECT 
        total
    FROM 
        cumulative
    WHERE 
        ROUND(100.0 * cum_count / total_count, 2) >= 90
    LIMIT 1
)
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS removed
FROM 
    interest_metrics
WHERE 
    interest_id IN (
        SELECT 
            interest_id
        FROM 
            interest
        WHERE 
            total < (SELECT total FROM threshold)
    );

4. Does this decision make sense to remove these data points from a business perspective?
Example Query for Interests with All 14 Months Present:

SELECT 
    interest_id, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) AS total
FROM interest_metrics
GROUP BY interest_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) = 14;


Example Query for Removed Interests:

SELECT 
    interest_id, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) AS total
    interest_metrics
GROUP BY interest_id
HAVING total_months < 14;

--Explanation:
--From a business perspective, removing interests with less than 14 months may discard valuable insights, especially if these segments represent emerging or seasonal trends. Comparing the two queries above helps determine the trade-off between retaining consistent data and losing potential growth indicators.

--5. After removing these interests, how many unique interests are there for each month?

WITH interest AS (
    SELECT 
        interest_id, 
        COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) AS total
    FROM interest_metrics
    GROUP BY interest_id
),
threshold AS (
    SELECT 
        total
    FROM 
        (SELECT 
             total,
             COUNT(*) AS count,
             SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY total) AS cumulative,
             SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER () AS total_count
         FROM 
             interest
         GROUP BY 
             total) AS cumulative_dist
    WHERE 
        ROUND(100.0 * cumulative / total_count, 2) >= 90
    LIMIT 1
)
SELECT 
    month_year,
    COUNT(DISTINCT interest_id) AS unique
FROM interest_metrics
WHERE interest_id NOT IN (
        SELECT 
            interest_id
        FROM interest
        WHERE total< (SELECT total FROM threshold)
    )
GROUP BY 
    month_year
ORDER BY 
    month_year;
