Segment Analysis
1-Using our filtered dataset by removing the interests with less than 6 months worth of data, which are the top 10 and bottom 10 interests which have the largest composition values in any month_year? Only use the maximum composition value for each interest but you must keep the corresponding month_year
2-Which 5 interests had the lowest average ranking value?
3-5 interests had the largest standard deviation in their percentile_ranking value?
4-For the 5 interests found in the previous question - what was minimum and maximum percentile_ranking values for each interest and its corresponding year_month value? Can you describe what is happening for these 5 interests?
5-How would you describe our customers in this segment based off their composition and ranking values? What sort of products or services should we show to these customers and what should we avoid?


1. Top 10 and Bottom 10 Interests with the Largest Composition Values in Any month_year (after filtering)
Task: Filter interests with less than 6 months of data and retrieve the top 10 and bottom 10 interests based on the largest composition values for each month_year, using the maximum composition value for each interest.


WITH filtered AS (
    SELECT 
        interest_id, 
        month_year, 
        MAX(composition_value) AS max_comp
    FROM interest_metrics
    GROUP BY interest_id, month_year
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT month_year) >= 6
)
SELECT 
    interest_id, 
    month_year, 
    max_comp
FROM filtered
ORDER BY max_comp DESC
LIMIT 10;

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    interest_id, 
    month_year, 
    max_comp
FROM filtered
ORDER BY max_comp ASC
LIMIT 10;

2. The 5 Interests with the Lowest Average Ranking Value
Task: Identify the 5 interests with the lowest average ranking value across all month_year values.

SELECT 
    interest_id, 
    AVG(ranking_value) AS avg_ranking
FROM interest_metrics
GROUP BY interest_id
ORDER BY avg_ranking ASC
LIMIT 5;

3. The 5 Interests with the Largest Standard Deviation in Their percentile_ranking Values
Task: Find the 5 interests with the largest standard deviation in their percentile_ranking values across all month_year values.

SELECT 
    interest_id, 
    STDDEV(percentile_ranking) AS stddev_percent
FROM interest_metrics
GROUP BY interest_id
ORDER BY stddev_percent DESC
LIMIT 5;

4. Minimum and Maximum percentile_ranking Values for the Top 5 Interests (from the previous question)
Task: For the 5 interests with the largest standard deviation in percentile_ranking, find the minimum and maximum percentile_ranking values for each interest and their corresponding year_month values.

WITH top5 AS (
    SELECT 
        interest_id
    FROM interest_metrics
    GROUP BY interest_id
    HAVING STDDEV(percentile_ranking) > (
        SELECT MAX(STDDEV(percentile_ranking))
        FROM interest_metrics
        GROUP BY interest_id
        ORDER BY STDDEV(percentile_ranking) DESC
        LIMIT 5
    )
)
SELECT 
    im.interest_id, 
    MIN(im.percentile_ranking) AS min_percent
    MAX(im.percentile_ranking) AS max_percent, 
    im.month_year
FROM interest_metrics im
JOIN top5 t ON im.interest_id = t.interest_id
GROUP BY im.interest_id, im.month_year
ORDER BY im.interest_id, im.month_year;

5. Describing Customers Based on Composition and Ranking Values
Task: Describe customers in the segment based on their composition and ranking values. Recommend the types of products/services to show to these customers and those to avoid.

SELECT 
    interest_id, 
    AVG(composition_value) AS avg_comp, 
    AVG(ranking_value) AS avg_ranking
FROM interest_metrics
WHERE interest_id IN (
    -- Include the interest IDs from previous findings
)
GROUP BY interest_id
ORDER BY avg_comp DESC;

Business Insight Description (Interpretation):
Composition and Ranking Values: Customers with higher composition values might indicate strong engagement or interest in specific areas, while higher ranking values could reflect their level of satisfaction or importance.

Recommendations:
Customers with high composition and ranking values may benefit from premium, feature-rich products or services.
Customers with lower values may need basic, introductory offerings or incentives to improve engagement.
